# 📝 Disease Condition Prediction Based on Drug Reviews

## 📝 Description 
This project aims to classify disease conditions of patients using drug reviews provided by patients in a dataset from the UCI ML Repository. The project employs various machine learning models and text processing techniques for disease condition prediction.

## ⌛ Dataset 
The dataset used in this project is sourced from the UCI ML Repository's. The dataset contains drug reviews along with their corresponding conditions.

## 🎯 Approach 
1. Importing required libraries for data preprocessing and machine learning.
2. Loading and exploring the dataset.
3. Performing exploratory data analysis to understand the data distribution and characteristics.
4. Data preprocessing, including text cleaning, removing stopwords, and lemmatization.
5. Creating features and the target variable for classification.
6. Splitting the data into training and testing sets.
7. Implementing machine learning models (Naive Bayes and Passive Aggressive Classifier) for disease condition prediction.
8. Evaluating the model performance using accuracy and confusion matrix.
9. Extracting most informative features from the trained model.
10. Saving the final model and vectorizer for future use.

## 📥 Installations 
- Python
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, seaborn, scikit-learn, matplotlib, nltk, bs4, wordcloud

## ⚙️ Setup 
1. Clone the repository: `git clone <repository-url>`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd disease-condition-prediction`
3. Install the required libraries: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## 🛠️ Requirements 
- Dataset: drugsComTrain_raw.tsv (available in the 'data' folder)
- Python
- Internet connection to download the dataset and libraries (if not already installed)

## 🚀 Technology Used 
- Python

## ▶️ Run 
To run the project, follow these steps:
1. Ensure you have the required dataset (drugsComTrain_raw.tsv) in the 'drug' folder.
2. Open the 'disease_condition_prediction.ipynb' notebook in Jupyter Notebook.
3. Run each cell sequentially to execute the code and perform disease condition prediction.
4. The final predictions will be displayed in the output cells.
